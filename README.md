## Overview

The library is a convenient alternative to sharing a root domain cookie.
Unlike cookies, your client-side data isn't limited to a few kilobytes - you
get up to 2.49M chars. For a client-heavy application, you can potentially
shave a few KB off your request headers by avoiding cookies. This is all thanks
to LocalStorage, which is available in IE 8+, FF 3.5+, Chrome 4+, as well as a
majority of mobile browsers. For a list of compatible browsers, refer to
[caniuse](http://caniuse.com/#feat=namevalue-storage).

How does it work? The library is divided into two types of components: hubs
and clients. The hubs reside on a host of choice and interact directly with
the LocalStorage API. The clients then load said hub over an embedded iframe
and post messages, requesting data to be stored, retrieved, and deleted. This
allows multiple clients to access and share the data located in a single store.

Care should be made to limit the origins of the bidirectional communication.
As such, when initializing the hub, an array of permissions objects is passed.
Any messages from clients whose origin does not match the pattern are ignored,
as well as those not within the allowed set of methods. The set of permissions
are enforced thanks to the same-origin policy. However, keep in mind that any
user has full control of their local storage data - it's still client data.
This only restricts access on a per-domain or web app level.

**Hub**

``` javascript
// Config s.t. subdomains can get, but only the root domain can set and del
CrossStorageHub.init([
  {origin: /\.example.com$/,            allow: ['get']},
  {origin: /:\/\/(www\.)?example.com$/, allow: ['get', 'set', 'del']}
]);
```

Note the $ for matching the end of the string. The RegExps in the above example
will match origins such as valid.example.com, but not
invalid.example.com.malicious.com.

**Client**

``` javascript
var storage = new CrossStorageClient('https://store.example.com/hub.html');

storage.onConnect().then(function() {
  return storage.set('newKey', 'foobar');
}).then(function() {
  return storage.get('existingKey', 'newKey');
}).then(function(res) {
  console.log(res.length); // 2
}).catch(function(err) {
  // Handle error
});
```

## Installation

The library can be installed via bower:

``` bash
bower install cross-storage
```

Or using npm:

``` bash
npm install cross-storage
```

along with browserify:

``` javascript
var CrossStorageClient = require('cross-storage').CrossStorageClient;
var CrossStorageHub    = require('cross-storage').CrossStorageHub;
```

When serving the hub, you may want to set the CORS and CSP headers for your
server depending on client/hub location. For example:

``` javascript
{
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin':  '*',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET,PUT,POST,DELETE',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'X-Requested-With',
  'Content-Security-Policy':      "default-src 'unsafe-inline' *",
  'X-Content-Security-Policy':    "default-src 'unsafe-inline' *",
  'X-WebKit-CSP':                 "default-src 'unsafe-inline' *",
}
```

If using inline JS to create the hub, you'll need to specify `unsafe-inline`
for the CSP headers. Otherwise, it can be left out if simply including the
init code via another resource.

## API

#### CrossStorageHub.init(permissions)

Accepts an array of objects with two keys: origin and allow. The value
of origin is expected to be a RegExp, and allow, an array of strings.
The cross storage hub is then initialized to accept requests from any of
the matching origins, allowing access to the associated lists of methods.
Methods may include any of: get, set, del, getKeys, clear and listen. A 'ready'
message is sent to the parent window once complete.

``` javascript
CrossStorageHub.init([
  {origin: /localhost:3000$/, allow: ['get', 'set', 'del', 'getKeys', 'clear', 'listen']}
]);
```

#### new CrossStorageClient(url, [opts])

Constructs a new cross storage client given the url to a hub. By default,
an iframe is created within the document body that points to the url. It
also accepts an options object, which may include a timeout, frameId, and
promise. The timeout, in milliseconds, is applied to each request and
defaults to 5000ms. The options object may also include a frameId,
identifying an existing frame on which to install its listeners. If the
promise key is supplied the constructor for a Promise, that Promise library
will be used instead of the default window.Promise.

``` javascript
var storage = new CrossStorageClient('http://localhost:3000/hub.html');

var storage = new CrossStorageClient('http://localhost:3000/hub.html', {
  timeout: 5000,
  frameId: 'storageFrame'
});
```

#### CrossStorageClient.prototype.onConnect()

Returns a promise that is fulfilled when a connection has been established
with the cross storage hub. Its use is required to avoid sending any
requests prior to initialization being complete.

``` javascript
storage.onConnect().then(function() {
  // ready!
});
```

#### CrossStorageClient.prototype.set(key, value)

Sets a key to the specified value. Returns a promise that is fulfilled on
success, or rejected if any errors setting the key occurred, or the request
timed out.

``` javascript
storage.onConnect().then(function() {
  return storage.set('key', JSON.stringify({foo: 'bar'}));
});
```

#### CrossStorageClient.prototype.get(key1, [key2], [...])

Accepts one or more keys for which to retrieve their values. Returns a
promise that is settled on hub response or timeout. On success, it is
fulfilled with the value of the key if only passed a single argument.
Otherwise it's resolved with an array of values. On failure, it is rejected
with the corresponding error message.

``` javascript
storage.onConnect().then(function() {
  return storage.get('key1');
}).then(function(res) {
  return storage.get('key1', 'key2', 'key3');
}).then(function(res) {
  // ...
});
```

#### CrossStorageClient.prototype.del(key1, [key2], [...])

Accepts one or more keys for deletion. Returns a promise that is settled on
hub response or timeout.

``` javascript
storage.onConnect().then(function() {
  return storage.del('key1', 'key2');
});
```

#### CrossStorageClient.prototype.getKeys()

Returns a promise that, when resolved, passes an array of keys currently
in storage.

``` javascript
storage.onConnect().then(function() {
  return storage.getKeys();
}).then(function(keys) {
  // ['key1', 'key2', ...]
});
```

#### CrossStorageClient.prototype.clear()

Returns a promise that, when resolved, indicates that all localStorage
data has been cleared.

``` javascript
storage.onConnect().then(function() {
  return storage.clear();
});
```

#### CrossStorageClient.prototype.listen(fn)

Adds an event listener to the storage event in the hub. The callback will
be invoked on any storage event not originating from that client. The
callback will be invoked with an object containing the following keys taken
from the original event: `key`, `newValue`, `oldValue` and `url`. Returns a
promise that resolves to a listener id that can be used to unregister the
listener.

``` javascript
storage.onConnect().then(function() {
  return storage.listen(function(event) {
    console.log(event);
  });
}).then(function(id) {
  // id can be passed to storage.unlisten
});
```

#### CrossStorageClient.prototype.unlisten(id)

Removes the registered listener with the supplied id. Returns a promise
that resolves on completion.

``` javascript
storage.unlisten(id);
```

#### CrossStorageClient.prototype.close()

Deletes the iframe and sets the connected state to false. The client can
no longer be used after being invoked.

``` javascript
storage.onConnect().then(function() {
  return storage.set('key1', 'key2');
}).catch(function(err) {
  // Handle error
}).then(function() {
  storage.close();
});
```

## Compatibility

For compatibility with older browsers, simply load a Promise polyfill such as
[es6-promise](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise).

You can also use RSVP or any other ES6 compliant promise library. Supports IE8
and up using the above polyfill. A JSON polyfill is also required
for IE8 in Compatibility View. Also note that `catch` is a reserved word in IE8,
and so error handling with promises can be done as:

``` javascript
storage.onConnect().then(function() {
  return storage.get('key1');
}).then(function(res) {
  // ... on success
})['catch'](function(err) {
  // ... on error
});
```

**Breaking Changes**

API breaking changes were introduced in both 0.6 and 1.0. Refer to
[releases](https://github.com/zendesk/cross-storage/releases) for details.

**Notes on Safari 7+ (OSX, iOS)**

All cross-domain local storage access is disabled by default with Safari 7+.
This is a result of the "Block cookies and other website data" privacy setting
being set to "From third parties and advertisers". Any cross-storage client
code will not crash, however, it will only have access to a sandboxed, isolated
local storage instance. As such, none of the data previously set by other
origins will be accessible. If an option, one could fall back to using root
cookies for those user agents, or requesting the data from a server-side store.

## Compression

Most localStorage-compatible browsers offer at least ~5Mb of storage. But keys
and values are defined as DOMStrings, which are UTF-8 encoded using single
16-bit sequences. That means a string of ~2.5 million ASCII characters will use
up ~5Mb, since they're 2 bytes per char.

If you need to maximize your storage space, consider using
[lz-string](https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string/). For smaller strings, it's
not uncommon to see a 50% reduction in size when compressed, which will bring
you a lot closer to 5 million characters. At that point, you're only limited by
the average compression rate of your strings.

## Building

The minified, production JavaScript can be generated with gulp by running
`gulp dist`. If not already on your system, gulp can be installed using
`npm install -g gulp`

## Tests

Tests can be ran locally using `npm test`. Tests are ran using Zuul, and
the Travis CI build uses Sauce Labs for multi-browser testing as well.
